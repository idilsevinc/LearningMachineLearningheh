# Random Forest Classifier in Supervised Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a **Random Forest Classifier**, a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It leverages multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

### 🔍 What is a **Random Forest Classifier**?
A **Random Forest** is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to make more robust predictions. The algorithm:
- Randomly selects subsets of data for training each tree (Bootstrap Aggregating).
- Aggregates predictions (majority vote for classification).
- Reduces overfitting compared to individual decision trees.

### 🤖 What is **Supervised Machine Learning**?
**Supervised learning** is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning it learns from examples where the correct classification is already known.
